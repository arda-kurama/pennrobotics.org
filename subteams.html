        There are 7 main subteams that make up Penn Robotics, each with their
        own distinct purpose and role on the team.

            Our business subteam is primarily concerned with funding our team.
            Each year, we organize a budget and forecast the amount that should
            be spent on our robot, team, and community. Annually around 80,000
            dollars is raised on our team to put towards manufacturing, wiring,
            programming, designing a robot to compete with. A large portion of
            the funding also goes towards community outreach and helping people
            in need.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="even">
          <p>
            Out funding usually comes from sponsorships, fundraisers, and
            grants. We send letters to local businesses, set up fundraisers, and
            apply for government grants to reach our set goal. At the end of
            each season, we take a chunk of what’s left, and pack it away for a
            boost in the coming season as well. Our business subteam is full of
            opportunity and allows students to learn the basics of business that
            can be applied in the real world.

          <p>
            Media’s job is to show the face of our team. In the media subteam,
            we use a variety of skills to present our team to the public in the
            best possible light. These skills include things like taking quality
            pictures, using photoshop, editing videos, and making posts on
            social media.

          <p>
            Media is responsible for all of the visual content our team puts
            out, so it is crucial that we have a large repository of pictures at
            our disposal at all times. At least one representative from the
            media team should be present at all outreach events so that
            documentation can take place.

            Most programming documentation, including downloading software,
            setting up code, basic programming, and information about basic
            connecting parts, can be found on the WPILib website. Linked within
            the WPILib website is the API documentation for your desired
            programming language (Java or C++).

            Our programming subteam focuses on taking the robot built by
            manufacturing and design, and getting it to move through complex
            instructions in the form of programming. A barebones kit from FIRST
            contains the constraints on what the electronics can be on the
            robot, but other than that, everything else is for the wiring team
            to figure out.

        <div class="content" id="even">
          <p>
            When first building a robot, the wiring system is pre planned on
            paper to ensure that all of the mechanical components are arranged
            and wired up in the most efficient way possible. This subteam uses
            tools including wire crimper, soldering irons, and wire strippers to
            systemize the wiring board.

            Our outreach subteam is dedicated to improving the state of STEM
            education and opportunities for young people in our community
            through FIRST Robotics. From event planning to networking to
            documenting, there are several skills that members of our team
            develop in running outreach events. We strive to make a positive
            impact on our community and keep our team sustainable to guarantee
            the same quality of work for years to come.

            The biggest ways that we spread FIRST are through national
            conventions such as the ATIA conference, IMTS, and IDEAcon, as well
            as youth camps such as our 8+ summer camps and fall and winter
            workshops we host throughout the year. Feel free to reference the
            Outreach section of our website to see all the ways that we promote
            STEM and FIRST.

            Our Manufacturing Subteam works closely with the Design Subteam to
            create the parts and systems that they design. We take the
            conceptual designs from the Design Subteam and figure out the best
            way to turn the designs into physical parts. Students learn advanced
            manufacturing principles utilising manual and CNC lathes and mills
            as well as a multitude of hand tools.
