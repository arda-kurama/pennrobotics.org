            Penn Robotics Mentors went to all 11 PHM elementary schools to mentor the Short Circuits program. Over the course of a month, we met 4 times to teach them how to use block codes to make a Sphero Bolt complete different complex exercises. This culminated into a final celebration in our robotics lab where they showcased their programs to their parents and teachers, as well as members of our education foundation, school board members, and our district’s superintendent. Following this program, many more of our district’s teachers and parents are now interested in continuing to support robotics in our schools.

          <p>Not only do we provide students with a unique one-on-one, hands-on
            learning experience, but we make sure your kids have fun in the
            process! Coopertition (cooperation and competition) is a large part of
            robotics at the high school level, and we make sure we bring that same
            experience to your kids when they enroll in any of our Penn Robotics
            Youth Camps.</p>
          <p>We offer eight separate camps for students ages 1st through 8th grade. Skill levels differ from camp to camp, but there if your student is interested in STEM and robotics we most certainly have a camp for them!</p>

            Our school’s Junior STEM camps teach K-5 grade students important
            real-world concepts such as critical-thinking, problem-solving, and
            teamwork while building robots and having fun!

            In the camps, students work in teams to design, build and code a
            robot to complete various challenges. Each day, students are given a
            robot challenge such as lifting an object and placing in a specific
            location, completing an obstacle course, climbing an incline with
            weights, and more. Students learn about engineering principles such
            as torque, tension, and mechanics that would help with the
            challenge.

            After the challenge is given, students are given isometric graph
            paper and asked to sketch their designs. Each team discusses the
            best design for the robot, then the students begin to build using
            the VEX IQ Kits. VEX IQ Kits include a platform made out of a
            material similar to Legos, so students of all ages can easily build
            a robot and make adjustments as needed. <br></br>To program the robot, students use a platform similar to Scratch
            called RobotC Graphical. In the platform, students learn how to
            program a robot using a robot controller and a pre-coded program.
            Finally, each team works together to complete the challenge before
            they move to the next rotation.

              Students have the opportunity to learn how to design using 3D
              modeling software. Each student is then able to bring their
              computer model to life using our 3D printers and/or CNC laser
              cuter. Students are able to gain hands-on knowledge and
              experience with the assistance of our current high school
              robotics student mentors.

              This workshop will focus on building a VEX Robot to program and
              drive through an obstacle course. Students will gain valuable
              knowledge in building and programming a custom robot to compete
              on a challenge course. This workshop will greatly help students
              hoping to take engineering courses at Penn, as VEX is commonly
              used in these classes.
