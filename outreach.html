                Penn Robotics Members ran a 2 day Workshop focused around
                teaching STEM skills through a variety of different ways.These
                kids were able construct their own laser cut trains, which they
                then put through a series of challenges and activities. This
                camp has grown to over 6 times the size of our previous Fall
                Workshop, with 88 students attending this year! We also provided
                several scholarships to our camp to make this camp as accessible
                as possible. We hope to continue inspiring STEM education for
                these students in our community.

                Penn Robotics Mentors went to all 11 PHM elementary schools to
                mentor the Short Circuits program. Over the course of a month,
                we met 4 times to teach them how to use block codes to make a
                Sphero Bolt complete different complex exercises. This
                culminated into a final celebration in our robotics lab where
                they showcased their programs to their parents and teachers, as
                well as members of our education foundation, school board
                members, and our district’s superintendent. Following this
                program, many more of our district’s teachers and parents are
                now interested in continuing to support robotics in our schools.

                To continue the tradition Penn Robotics hosted our annual summer
                camps in 2022, hosting students grades K-8th from throughout the
                school district. In our Manufacturing camp students were able to
                learn hands-on operation of machines such as mills, the CNC, and
                the laser cutter, using these in the production of a customized
                totem to take home at the end of the week. Mentors of Creativity
                challenged campers to learn key STEM concepts by competing to
                build the most stable satellites, tallest moon bases, and
                fastest rovers, ending the camp by designing their own rockets
                and launching them sky-high. Design students worked with CAD
                using Fusion, and built their own race cars to send flying down
                the air-pressure track in exciting high-speed races against
                their peers. In Software, we taught fundamental concepts of
                programming through the use of the BBC Micro Bit, exciting the
                campers by letting them watch their code come to life, including
                music and games they could play; additionally, they learned
                about electricity by creating airplane toys with working motors,
                inspiring them to continue programming and being involved with
                STEM. The second week featured our Build-a-Bot camps; these
                emulate the FIRST robotics competition in guiding kids through
                the creation, programming, and driving of either a Vex IQ or EDR
                robot in order to complete game challenges developed by the Penn
                Robotics teams. For this year’s IQ camp the challenge was called
                Lunar Launch, which included rockets robots had to fuel and
                dangerous asteroids to clear. The game for EDR was Moon Mayhem,
                featuring a spinning moon and satellite arrays that teams had to
                traverse to deliver moon rocks and gems back to their factories.

                materials, and mentors that we do, and we're happy to be able to
                share some of these resources with other teams in the area.
                We've earmarked over $12,500 of aluminum to donate, and made
                plans to give this metal to four other teams for them to use

                Penn Robotics set up and hosted the FTC Metro League Meet One.
                This was the first FTC tournament for the metro league,
                consisting of 12 teams from the northern half of Indiana. The
                setup for the event took place on December 3rd, and after a few
                hours of dedicated work a practice field, pit areas, and
                competition field were set up. The League meet on December 4th
                helped teams experience working together in a competitive
                setting, acted as a stepping stone for teams to build and grow
                from, and allowed for many students to learn how an FTC
                tournament functions.

                with Inventor, using the laser cutter to print out images, and
                programming a Vex EDR robot. The kids greatly enjoyed watching

                We held a Nelson’s chicken sale at River Valley Church. To
                ensure this event’s success, we used a pre-sale system of
                redeemable tickets which we sold in the weeks leading up to the
                event. Due to our efforts in coordination and documentation, the
                pre-sale process was extraordinarily successful. Our Team sold
                753 chicken and 506 potato tickets a week before the event even
                took place. From there, we notified Nelson’s of our order and
                prepared further for our actual “day of” sale. Ordering 1000
                chickens and 700 potatoes, this was one of the largest Nelson’s
                chicken sales in Penn Robotics history. The day of the event,
                many members of FTC, FRC, and other volunteers spent six hours
                distributing all of our food to those who ordered. The sale was
                extremely successful, raising more money at one location than
                the previous year’s did with two sales. Penn Robotics netted
                over $5,000 through this sale, and we are excited to spend it as
                we tackle our upcoming 2022 season!

                Penn Robotics hosted the annual FTC Kickoff, consisting of an
                unveiling of this season’s challenge and several presentations
                to give teams a stepping stone for the coming year. This event
                attracts teams from around the area to come watch as the FTC
                game for this season is revealed, and this year we reached 10
                FTC teams and around 90 people. Members from three veteran FTC
                teams and our own FRC team gave presentations, which helped the
                new FTC teams understand and familiarize themselves with the
                processes they will need to know during the season, as well as
                hearing how the veteran teams succeeded. In addition to our
                presentations, we provided a reveal of the playing field,
                allowing teams to get close to and physically understand and
                interact with the field and game elements. What we did at the
                Kickoff will improve these FTC teams’ chances of success in the
                coming season.

                Penn Robotics persevered through the pandemic to continue its
                tradition of hosting STEM summer camps. During our first week of
                summer camps, we held multiple interactive programs where kids
                get to learn more in-depth about aspects of engineering! These
                programs had kids participate in a variety of challenges that
                they overcame using their knowledge of engineering principals.
                Week 2 had kids designing their own unique robots to compete in
                an exciting FIRST style competition. Using Computer-Aided
                Design, laser cutters, and code they wrote, they competed
                against each other. They spent their time in the camp learning
                3D design, coding, assembly, and most importantly, teamwork.
                This year, we had over 300 students come to our summer camp!
                We’re incredibly happy to be able to teach so many the ins and
                outs of engineering, and hope to do so next year as well. This
                15th year of Penn Build-a-Bot VEX IQ & EDR camps challenged
                students to design, build, and program their own unique robots
                to compete in a FIRST style game. They learned how to use
                Computer-Aided Design (CAD), laser-cut designs, how to use the
                coding software, and many more skills that will be helpful for
                them in the future. We also hosted our Junior STEM camps for
                students in grades K-5. This program allows us to simulate some
                aspects of the Build-a-Bot camps for younger students. The
                students use Vex parts to build robots which allow them to
                accomplish certain goals. They also learn about orthographic and
                isometric drawings, drawing several of them. In total, we
                reached almost 200 families and over 300 students, including
                about 20 students from outside of our district. We are teaching
                these students about some of the fundamentals of engineering in
                the hopes that we can help them in some way.

                For the 2020 holiday season, Penn Robotics hosted an event for
                families to enjoy: A Robotics Fair! Our goal was to take our
                Adapt-A-Thon event and make it friendly and exciting, alongside
                offering kids an experience they would not get at a normal fair.
                So this year, Penn decided to transform our Adapt-A-Thon event
                into a drive-thru fair, with activities for everyone to
                participate in! Every year, during the holidays, many children
                with disabilities aren’t able to purchase switch adapted toys
                due to the astronomical prices of toys and switches from
                vendors. We created this event so children aren’t hindered from
                having their dream toys and experience the joy of the holiday
                season. Families came to the fair throughout the day and enjoyed
                a variety of events; from tic-tac-toe, to experiencing robotics,
                to picking out a toy to take home. As kids came to the fair,
                they were able to pick out a toy, talk to the team, and
                experience robotics and how it can help improve and develop our
                community. The remaining toys from the Adapt-A-Thon will be
                donated to local organizations that work with kids with
                disabilities.

                competing in one of the most competitive FRC Districts in
                America. 135 chose the Macomb Community College Event to give
                our driver and build sub-teams more insight on how to improve
                our robot before the Indiana District events. Overall, the trip
                was a success; We gained insight to improve our shooting system
                for power cells, as well as discover flaws that can be fixed for
                future events. Furthermore, our Chairman’s sub-team was able to
                have some valuable dialogue with Team 2834 The Bionic
                Blackhawks, who is an FRC Hall of Fame team. During alliance
                selection, Team 135 was picked by Alliance 6, composed of Team
                772 (Sabre Bytes) and Team 2834 (Bionic Blackhawks). Although we
                did not make it past quarterfinals, it was a valuable lesson for
                our team and led to great improvements for our robot!

                Penn Robotics helped with running the annual FLL competition
                along with Mishawaka robotics. With both the FRC and FTC
                students helping out, this event was a huge success! There were
                about 450 people that attended the event, including over 20
                teams, coaches, mentors, volunteers, and community members. Like
                always, FLL teams presented the non-game aspects of their team
                in three judging categories: “Project”, “Core Values”, and
                “Technical”. In these areas, teams were judged based on the hard
                work and dedication showcased towards effectively executing the
                requirements/tasks of each judging category whilst integrating
                the values of FIRST and STEM. We also had a few FRC members
                present to students and parents during the event regarding the
                robotics programs, summer camps, and STEM opportunities offered
                at Penn as well as their benefits to further assisting in the
                development of innovative and collaborative thinking today’s
                youth. Teams then went on to compete in the main event, the
                robot competition! During the robot matches, teams competed in
                that year’s FLL challenge: City Shaper! In the end, all teams
                performed wonderfully! Regarding volunteers during the event,
                Penn students helped with running “official positions”,
                consisting of judging room timers, door keepers, judge’s
                assistants, robot-run helpers, and various other positions. We
                also had both the FRC and FTC booths set up at the event,
                including the FTC field, competition robots, and various other
                outreach props. Volunteers interacted with various community
                members, teams, alumni, and school leaders and showcased the
                values of Penn Robotics, FIRST, and STEM. Various community
                members expressed positive regard to their experience and time
                at the event, including school leaders such as Mr. Galiher
                (Principal of Penn High School)! Overall, this event ran

                was open to FTC and FRC teams to listen to other robotics
                presentations in technical and non-technical fields. During the
                presentation, our audience members were engrossed and impressed
                by the content that we covered in our FRC presentation. Team
                members brought back valuable information and want to embed them
                into the robotics team. Overall, it was a success and the team
                enjoyed and valued this forum.

                Penn Robotics went to the annual PHMEF Superintendents Luncheon.
                We set up in front of the main entrance door and displayed our
                ME (Mission to Engineer) and robotics information. Approximately
                300 people showed up at this event and all of them got to see
                our table set up before they entered the conference hall. It was
                really exciting to talk about STEM and FIRST programs and tell
                people how these programs can impact our community. We had some
                technical issues but we managed to fix them in a pretty short
                time span. We got to listen to a few speakers during the
                luncheon. Most notably, the guest speaker Sarah Hildebrant. A
                few people compliment complimented our team for our robotics
                program as they were passing by; overall, it was a success! Next
                time we should only bring one robot and give some notes to Dr.
                Thacker so he could talk about our program during his speech and
                also improve the packing list so the process of getting
                everything prepped for an event becomes more fluid.

                For the 2019 holiday season, Penn Robotics Team 135 partnered up
                with Beacon health Foundation to run an Adapt-A-Thon. Our goal
                was to give away free adapted toys to children in need and help
                them experience the magic of the holidays. The toys consist of
                stuffed animals that make lights, sounds, or movements when a
                button is pressed. The premise of the event was adapting
                electronic toys to become compatible with switches (a sensitive
                button that people with disabilities can activate), so children
                with disabilities can play with them. We also gave away our
                custom made switches, which can be fairly expensive to buy
                normally, for free. As we are approaching the holidays, many
                children with disabilities will not be able to purchase switch
                adapted toys that they can interact with due to the astronomical
                prices of toys and switches from vendors. We hope these toys
                will allow the children a form of autonomy in their lives and
                give inclusivity by allowing them a similar experience and joy
                like their peers. At the event, we had a table of toys for
                children to pick from, and we were able to adapt the toys as
                people came in with them. There were stations set up for games
                and prizes in addition to an adapting station, where people can
                see the wiring close up if they would like to. We were able to
                do a couple of extra-special adaptations, including adapting a
                toy car so that a child with disabilities could drive it. The
                remaining toys from the Adapt-A-Thon will be donated to local
                organizations that work with kids with disabilities.

                Technovation is a yearly teacher conference at Penn High School.
                The goal of the conference is to encourage teachers to explore
                teaching using technology and learn about how they can better do
                this. This year, Penn Robotics did three presentations at the
                conference and held a booth in the library with information
                about our program and demonstration robots for attendees to
                drive. One of our presentations was centered around Mission to
                Engineer and the importance of the program as well as how the
                teachers can utilize it as a learning opportunity. Our other
                presentation was an escape room. The escape room was especially
                popular and taught teachers team building skills. Our other team
                presented how the FIRST program introduces project-based
                learning to students and how to produce a similar model for
                conventional classroom use. The team engaged each teacher who
                attended by discussing the different benefits of project-based
                learning, better retention of lessons, and the introduction of
                important attributes such as critical thinking, teamwork, and
                problem-solving. Through the presentation, we were able to
                establish contact with a teacher interested in starting an FLL
                team. In all the presentations, we had an opportunity to show
                teachers all across Indiana what Team 135 and the FIRST program
                entails as well as how it benefits students.

                Penn Robotics hosted our second annual FTC kickoff.
                Approximately 150 people showed up to represent almost 30 FTC
                teams. Before the event, we held a food social where people
                could come and get to know each other. Afterward, we held seven
                different tech sessions, four of which were presented by 135
                members. The game was released and we let the teams get on the
                field and begin brainstorming. The FTC Kickoff is a very
                important event because FTC offers a direct line to FRC, which
                makes supporting FTC a major aspect of Penn Robotics’
                sustainability. FTC Kickoff also helps us break the barrier
                between FTC and FRC. The event was very successful and we got a
                lot of compliments from parents and coaches. Any outreach event
                we take part in helps spread the message about what we do here
                at Penn Robotics.

                The back to school night was a great success for Penn Robotics.
                We disseminated to the various elementary schools in PHM in
                order to spread the message of the FLL teams we were going to
                start. We managed to get to a decent amount of elementary
                schools, and because we started our first FLL team at Penn,
                Students would describe the event as a great success. One of the
                best moments of the event was when kids would literally drag
                their parents over when they saw our booth. There are a lot of
                things to improve on, however. We started to plan the event way
                too late and not a lot of people showed up. Additionally we did
                not follow through on asking for people to volunteer. Our stuff
                was not fully packed up for the first couple of events and
                because of the short time deadline, it was a bit of a mess. In
                order to fix this situation, we need to get a master packing
                list way ahead of time and start planning the event at least two
                weeks in advance to stop this from happening again, as well as
                ask for volunteers in advance.
